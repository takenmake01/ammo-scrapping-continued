Adds a new item: ammo scrap, which can be crafted out of unwanted ammo at a loading bench.

It can then be smelted back into steel (at the cost of some of its total mass) or used in a few crafting recipes which use 100% of the material.

Ammo scrap IEDs are equivalent in power to a frag grenade. There is a trap IED as well as a non-trap version if you have the Remote Detonator mod loaded.

"Scrapshot" shotgun ammunition is similar to buckshot, but is cheaper and faster to produce at the cost of lower speed and damage.

Ammo scrap produced is proportional to the mass of the ammo used, and can be crafted from any ammo from the categories: Pistol, Rifle, Shotgun, Advanced, and High Caliber. There are two recipes: 1kg and 10kg. High Caliber ammunition is only included in the 10kg recipe to prevent wasting materials. All ingredients are disabled by default in the Bills menu.
